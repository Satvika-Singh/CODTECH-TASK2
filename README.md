**Overview of the project**    
PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION   

Implement a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous
target variables.  
Split the data into training and testing sets, train the model on
the training data, evaluate its performance using metrics like mean squared
error or R-squared, and make predictions on the test set.    

Key Technologies used  
Python: Primary language used for data analysis   
Pandas: Used for data and numbers manipulation    
Matplotlib: Used for creating static,animated and interactive visualizations    
Seaborn: Utilized for making statistical graphics that are informative and attractive     
Scikit-Learn : A highly useful python library used for statstical modelling,prediction and classification
